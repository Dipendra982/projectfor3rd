# File Upload System - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### Backend (API)

1. **Installed Multer**: Added `multer` dependency for handling multipart/form-data uploads
2. **Created Multer Middleware** (`/api/middleware/multer.js`):
   - Disk storage configuration
   - Unique filename generation (timestamp + random number)
   - File filtering for images only (jpeg, jpg, png, gif, webp)
   - 5MB file size limit
   - Automatic uploads directory creation

3. **Created Upload Controller** (`/api/controllers/upload.controller.js`):
   - `uploadSingle`: Handles single file uploads
   - `uploadMultiple`: Handles multiple file uploads (up to 10 files)
   - Returns file paths in `/uploads/filename` format

4. **Created Upload Routes** (`/api/routes/upload.route.js`):
   - `POST /api/upload/single`: Single file upload endpoint
   - `POST /api/upload/multiple`: Multiple files upload endpoint

5. **Updated Server** (`/api/server.js`):
   - Added static file serving for `/uploads` directory
   - Registered upload routes

### Frontend (Client)

1. **Updated Upload Utility** (`/client/src/utils/upload.js`):
   - Removed Cloudinary integration
   - Now sends files to local multer endpoint
   - Proper error handling

2. **Created Multiple Upload Utility** (`/client/src/utils/uploadMultiple.js`):
   - Handles multiple file uploads efficiently
   - Uses single API call instead of multiple individual calls

3. **Created Image URL Utility** (`/client/src/utils/getImageUrl.js`):
   - Converts local file paths to full URLs
   - Handles different image path formats
   - Fallback to default avatar

4. **Updated All Components to Use Local Images**:
   - `Navbar.jsx`: User profile pictures
   - `GigCard.jsx`: Gig cover images and user avatars
   - `Gig.jsx`: All image displays (slider, user avatars, recommended gigs)
   - `Review.jsx`: User profile pictures
   - `Message.jsx`: User avatars in chat
   - `Orders.jsx`: Order thumbnails
   - `ReceivedOrders.jsx`: Order thumbnails
   - `Add.jsx`: Optimized upload process

5. **Cleaned Up Configuration**:
   - Removed Cloudinary environment variables
   - Removed Cloudinary proxy from Vite config

## File Storage Structure

```
api/
├── uploads/              # Uploaded files directory
│   ├── file-timestamp-random.jpg
│   ├── files-timestamp-random.png
│   └── ...
└── middleware/
    └── multer.js         # Upload configuration
```

## API Endpoints

### Single File Upload
```bash
POST /api/upload/single
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Field: file

Response: {
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "url": "/uploads/filename.ext"
}
```

### Multiple Files Upload
```bash
POST /api/upload/multiple
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Field: files (array)

Response: {
  "message": "Files uploaded successfully", 
  "urls": ["/uploads/file1.ext", "/uploads/file2.ext"]
}
```

## File Access

Uploaded files are accessible at: `http://localhost:8800/uploads/filename.ext`

## Security Features

- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits (5MB)
- Unique filename generation (prevents conflicts)
- Proper error handling
- CORS configuration for frontend access

## Testing Completed

✅ Single file upload working
✅ Multiple file upload working  
✅ File serving working
✅ Frontend integration complete
✅ All components updated to use local images
✅ Error handling implemented

## Benefits

1. **No External Dependencies**: Removed reliance on Cloudinary
2. **Cost Effective**: No third-party service costs
3. **Fast Performance**: Local file serving
4. **Simple Setup**: Works immediately without configuration
5. **Full Control**: Complete control over file storage and access
6. **College Project Friendly**: Lightweight and self-contained
